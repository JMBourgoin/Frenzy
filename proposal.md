# Javascript Project Proposal: Iconfactory's FRENZIC
***
### Background
Iconfactory's Frenzic is a high pressure puzzle game that pits you against time. A player is challenged to fill 5 different empty circles with randomly colored pie-wedges before their time runs out.

Each circle is cleared and points are scored when a circle has been entirely filled with a successful collection of wedges (6 pie-slices each).  

Circles filled with all like-colored wedges score more points.  

The timer gradually accelerates as the game progresses.  A player loses a life if the timer runs out before successfully placing the current wedge.
