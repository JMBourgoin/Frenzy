# Javascript Project Proposal: Iconfactory's FRENZIC
***
### Background
Iconfactory's Frenzic is a high pressure puzzle game that pits you against time. A player is challenged to fill 5 different empty circles with randomly colored pie-wedges before their time runs out.

Each circle is cleared and points are scored when a circle has been entirely filled with a successful collection of wedges (6 pie-slices each).  

Circles filled with all like-colored wedges score more points.  

The timer gradually accelerates as the game progresses.  A player loses a life if the timer runs out before successfully placing the current wedge.

### Funtionality & MVP
With this Frenzic clone, users will be able to:
- [ ] start, pause, and restart the game.
- [ ] select and place the active pie-wedges into a fitting circle.
- [ ] clear circles containing a full (6) collection of pie-wedges.
- [ ] accrue points for cleared pies and additional points for clearing pies of the same color.
- [ ] store their initials and highscores into the highscore library.
